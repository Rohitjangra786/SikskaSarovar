Structure of PHP Application and its Execution into the Web
1. How PHP Works (Execution Flow)
PHP is a server-side scripting language. This means the code runs on the server, not the browser.
Step-by-Step Execution:
1. Comparison: Client Request: The user opens a browser and types a URL (e.g., www.example.com/index.php).
2. Server Processing: The request goes to the Web Server (Apache/Nginx).
3. PHP Engine: The server detects .php extension and sends the file to the PHP Interpreter.
4. Database Interaction (Optional): If needed, PHP asks the Database (MySQL) for data.
5. Generate HTML: PHP processes the code and generates a plain HTML page.
6. Response: The server sends the HTML back to the user’s browser.

2. Basic Structure of a PHP Script
A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.
Starts with: <?php
Ends with: ?>
Extension: .php
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>My First PHP Page</h1>
    <?php
        echo "Hello, World!";
    ?>
</body>
</html>
Important Points:
PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).
PHP is case-sensitive for variables ($color is different from $COLOR).
Keywords (e.g., if, else, echo) are not case-sensitive.

3. PHP Variables & Scope
3. Variables in PHP
A variable is a container for storing data.
Syntax: Start with $ sign.
$name = "Ankit";
$age = 21;

3.1 Variable Scope
Local Variable – Defined inside a function
Global Variable – Defined outside a function
Static Variable – Retains value between function calls
function test() {
  static $x = 0;
  $x++;
  echo $x;
}

4. PHP Super Global Variables
Super Globals are predefined variables available anywhere in the script.

PHP: Constants, Comments, Operators & Expressions, Regular Expressions, Advantages of PHP

1. PHP Constants
A constant is an identifier whose value cannot be changed once defined.
Features of Constants
Do not use $ symbol
Case-sensitive by default
Global scope
Defining Constants
define("SITE_NAME", "MyWebsite");
echo SITE_NAME;
Using const keyword:
const PI = 3.14;

2. PHP Comments
Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the PHP interpreter.
Types of Comments
Single-line comment
// This is a single-line comment
# This is also a single-line comment
Multi-line comment
/*
 This is
 a multi-line comment
*/

3. PHP Operators
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.
3.1 Arithmetic Operators
Operator
Description
+
Addition
-
Subtraction
*
Multiplication
/
Division
%
Modulus
echo 10 + 5;

3.2 Assignment Operators
Operator
Example
=
$x = 10
+=
$x += 5
-=
$x -= 2

3.3 Comparison Operators
Operator
Meaning
==
Equal
===
Identical
!=
Not equal
>
Greater than
if ($a == $b) { }

3.4 Logical Operators
Operator
Meaning
&&
AND
||
OR
!
NOT

3.5 Increment / Decrement Operators
$x++;
$y--;

4. PHP Expressions
An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and values that produces a result.
Example
$result = ($a + $b) * 2;

5. PHP Regular Expressions
Regular Expressions (Regex) are used for pattern matching in strings.
Common PHP Regex Functions
Function
Purpose
preg_match()
Match pattern
preg_replace()
Replace text
preg_split()
Split string

Example: Email Validation
$email = "test@gmail.com";
if (preg_match("/^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}$/i", $email)) {
  echo "Valid Email";
} else {
  echo "Invalid Email";
}

6. Advantages of PHP
Why Use PHP?
Open source and free
Easy to learn and use
Platform independent
Fast execution
Supports many databases
Large community support
Widely used in web development

**Control Statements in PHP
Conditional Statements & Loops**

1. Control Statements in PHP
Control statements are used to control the flow of execution of a PHP program.They help in decision making and repetition of tasks.
Control statements are mainly of two types:
Conditional Statements
Looping Statements

2. Conditional Statements in PHP
Conditional statements execute code based on conditions.

2.1 if Statement
Executes code only if the condition is true.
$age = 20;
if ($age >= 18) {
  echo "Eligible to vote";
}

2.2 if–else Statement
Executes one block if condition is true, otherwise another block.
$marks = 45;
if ($marks >= 40) {
  echo "Pass";
} else {
  echo "Fail";
}

2.3 if–elseif–else Statement
Used to test multiple conditions.
$marks = 75;
if ($marks >= 80) {
  echo "Grade A";
} elseif ($marks >= 60) {
  echo "Grade B";
} else {
  echo "Grade C";
}

2.4 Nested if Statement
An if statement inside another if statement.
$age = 22;
$citizen = true;

if ($age >= 18) {
  if ($citizen) {
    echo "Eligible to vote";
  }
}

2.5 switch–case Statement
Used when there are multiple fixed values.
$day = 3;
switch ($day) {
  case 1:
    echo "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    echo "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    echo "Wednesday";
    break;
  default:
    echo "Invalid day";
}
Important Points:
break stops execution
default executes if no case matches

3. Looping Statements in PHP
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

3.1 for Loop
Used when the number of iterations is known.
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
  echo $i . "<br>";
}

3.2 while Loop
Executes code while condition is true.
$i = 1;
while ($i <= 5) {
  echo $i . "<br>";
  $i++;
}

3.3 do–while Loop
Executes code at least once, even if condition is false.
$i = 1;
do {
  echo $i . "<br>";
  $i++;
} while ($i <= 5);

3.4 foreach Loop
Used to iterate through arrays.
$subjects = array("HTML", "CSS", "PHP");
foreach ($subjects as $sub) {
  echo $sub . "<br>";
}

Arrays in PHP Indexed Array, Associative Array, Multidimensional Array & Predefined Functions

1. Introduction to Arrays in PHP
An array is a special variable that can store multiple values in a single variable.Each value is stored with an index or key.
Why Use Arrays?
Store multiple related values
Reduce number of variables
Easy data management

2. Indexed Array
An indexed array uses numeric indexes (starting from 0 by default).
Declaration
$subjects = array("HTML", "CSS", "PHP", "JavaScript");
Accessing Elements
echo $subjects[0];   // HTML

3. Associative Array
An associative array uses named keys instead of numeric indexes.
Declaration
$student = array(
  "name" => "Rohit",
  "age" => 21,
  "course" => "BCA"
);

4. Multidimensional Array
A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays.
Example
$students = array(
  array("Amit", 20, "BCA"),
  array("Neha", 21, "BCA")
);

5. PHP Array Predefined Functions
PHP provides many built-in functions to handle arrays.
Common Array Functions:
count(), sort(), rsort(), array_push(), array_pop(), array_merge(), in_array()
