Place the actual Rohit Kumar portrait image here and name it exactly `rohit.jpg`.

Steps:

1. Replace the file `Images/rohit.jpg` with your photo (keep the same filename).
2. Recommended dimensions: 1200x1800 (portrait) or a similarly tall aspect ratio for best results.
3. Supported formats: JPEG or JPG. You may also use PNG but the code imports `rohit.jpg`.

If you want me to add the image for you, upload the image to this chat or grant permission and I'll add it to the repository at `Images/rohit.jpg`.
